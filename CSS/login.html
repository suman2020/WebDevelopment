		<h2>Login</h2>
		<p>	 
			In computer security, logging in (or logging on, signing in, or signing on) is the process by which an individual gains access to a computer system by identifying and authenticating themselves. The user credentials are typically some form of "username" and a matching "password",[1] and these credentials themselves are sometimes referred to as a login (or logon, sign-in, sign-on).[2][1] In practice, modern secure systems often require a second factor such as email or SMS confirmation for extra security.

			When access is no longer needed, the user can log out (log off, sign out or sign off).
