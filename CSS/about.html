		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>	No matter what ‘home’ means to you, there is surely something nostalgic about the place we call home. It’s the place where we eat, the place with friends and family, where we enjoy our home goods and decor, and it’s the place we make our own. Sometimes in life we could use a little reminder of how it feels to be home, to come home, and to leave home. Whether your loved ones are leaving home, coming home or seem to be missing home, these home sweet home quotes will remind them of all the good things (think unconditional love and mama’s cooking.)
