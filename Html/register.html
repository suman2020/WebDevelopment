<!-- 
NOTES:
	- create a form in a website
	- input tag creates an input box
	- Important input types:
	 	> text
	 	> email
	 	> date
	 	> radio: circle select buttons
	 	--- if the user must select one option to the least then we assign the same name to them: like in case of gender and found life purpose we've assigned the same name for the given options.
	 	> checkbox: square select buttons: select more options

	 	<select: drop down menu: default allows to select one option 
	 		<select multiple> 
	 	 	- multiple options can be selected by adding the multiple attribute into select
	 	 	- to select multiple items hold down the ctrl button on windows and command button on mac

<form method = "GET">
	- this will attach the following information related with the form in the url after the form is selected.
	- But it's better to use  method = "POST" that hides the submitted information in the url which protects user information. 
<form method = "POST"> 

<form action="action.php">
 	-- when the form is submitted, the action.php file is run on the backend that stores the user information.	


<div> :this tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document. Comes in handy with CSS and javascript

<span>: same as div but is specific to some lines or elements
